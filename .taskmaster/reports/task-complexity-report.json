      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for implementing data import from Google Sheets and CSV, as well as data export functionality, including error handling and user interface design.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration, data processing, and file handling. While complex, it's more straightforward than some of the other tasks in the project."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail each performance optimization technique, including implementation steps, expected impact, and methods for measuring improvement.",
      "reasoning": "Performance optimization requires a broad understanding of web technologies and careful measurement. Each technique needs to be implemented and tested individually."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down each security measure into implementation steps, including configuration details and testing procedures to ensure effectiveness.",
      "reasoning": "Security implementation is critical and complex, requiring in-depth knowledge of various security protocols and potential vulnerabilities. Each measure needs careful implementation and thorough testing."

      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of each anti-web scraping measure, including integration with existing systems, testing procedures, and ongoing monitoring strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex, involving multiple layers of security, advanced detection techniques, and infrastructure-level changes. It requires a comprehensive approach to security and deep technical knowledge across various domains."

      "taskTitle": "Implement API Routes and Data Fetching",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 12,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of Server Components and API routes for the analytics dashboard into detailed subtasks, including database access with Drizzle, authentication flows, external integrations (especially Google Sheets import), Server Actions for form handling, ISR caching for performance, middleware configuration, error handling, type-safety, and request validation with Zod. For each subtask, specify dependencies, implementation details, and testing requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex backend architecture with multiple integration points (database, authentication, external services). It requires implementing Server Components, API routes, middleware, caching strategies, and type-safe validation. The task has 9 existing subtasks but needs additional ones to cover Server Actions, ISR caching, type-safety with Zod, and external integrations in more detail. The dependencies on tasks 3-6 suggest this builds on previous database and authentication work, adding complexity."
